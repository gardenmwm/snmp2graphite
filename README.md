snmp2graphite
=============

SNMP Poller for Graphite, configured by ini. I wrote this because I wasn't thrilled with the collectd process and I wanted practice. It works for me, but no promises for anyone else.

config.ini controls where your graphite server is, hosts.ini is host deifnitions, collector is a list of collectors.
